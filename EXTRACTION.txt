PROCESSING
Processing the coffee cherries involves the critical removal of husk and fruit from the beans and the subsequent drying of the beans to 11% moisture content.
There are two 'the Dry method' and 'wet method'.
The dry method aka natural method. The cherries are laid out on cane matting under hot sun to dry. This is done to ensure even drying and prevent spoilage. It would take 2-3 weeks of good, dry weather to thoroughly dry the cherries.
The wet method aka washed method. The cherries are poured into large, water-filled tanks for its outer husks to remove. When softened, the cherries are run through a pulping machine to eliminate and wash away the outer husk and pulp. Then, are sorted by weight via water channels and then by size in rotating drums. Lastly, they are dried the same way as the dried method or in large drying machines that shorten the drying time.
